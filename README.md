# Generalized Additive Models - Concrete Strength Analysis
Predicting concrete compressive strength using GAM regression, as a non-linear function of the mixture components. Visualization of the results with 3D interactive Plotly plots.

[Report](https://rpubs.com/AhmetZamanis/ConcreteStrength) of the full analysis on RPubs. The interactive plots are too big for Github Markdown.

[RMarkdown code](https://github.com/AhmetZamanis/ConcreteStrengthGAM/blob/main/ConcreteStrengthGAM.Rmd). Outputs an HTML document, not a Github document. Not very clean.

[Dataset](https://github.com/AhmetZamanis/ConcreteStrengthGAM/blob/main/concrete_data.csv), retrieved from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/maajdl/yeh-concret-data). Originally [donated](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Concrete+Compressive+Strength) to the UCI Machine Learning Repository by Prof. I-Cheng Yeh.
